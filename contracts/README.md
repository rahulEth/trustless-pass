# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
solidity v0.8.13
create hardat.config.js file and copy past from sample_hardhat.config.js file

# compile solidity smart contract

npx hardhat compile

# deploy smart contract to Hedera Testnet

npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hederaTestnet

```
